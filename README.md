# sales_data_analysis_Atliq_Hardware

This project focuses on analyzing sales performance for AtliQ Hardware, an India-based company that supplies computer hardware and peripherals to multiple clients, including Surge Stores and Nomad Stores, across the country. The company’s headquarters is located in Delhi, with regional offices operating throughout North, South, and Central India.

AtliQ Hardware operates in a rapidly evolving market. Despite overall market growth, the Sales Director was facing significant challenges in tracking real-time sales performance and understanding why the company’s overall sales were declining. Sales updates were primarily communicated verbally by regional managers during phone calls, providing only high-level summaries and future growth expectations without factual data or visual evidence.

This lack of centralized, data-backed reporting made it difficult for leadership to gain a complete and accurate view of business performance. While regional managers reported optimistic projections, the actual sales figures told a different story. The absence of transparent, consistent insights led to frustration and limited the company’s ability to take timely, data-driven actions.

To address this challenge, the project aimed to build an interactive Power BI sales dashboard that provides clear, real-time insights into sales performance across regions, customers, and products. The dashboard enables the Sales Director and leadership team to monitor key metrics daily, identify declining trends, compare regional performance, and make informed strategic decisions.

By transforming raw sales data into meaningful visual insights, this project demonstrates how business intelligence tools can replace manual reporting, improve transparency, and support data-driven decision-making to drive sales growth and operational efficiency.
